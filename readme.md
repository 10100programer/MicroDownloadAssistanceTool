The Rundown
----------
Currently the idea is to have a database that stores what has been added to `plex/collection`, we may want to automate this and make it a manuel entry system.

I also want to support multiple plex servers, so the database will need to handle as many that is reasonable.

The program should be able to store the `METADATA` of the video or somthing simular, this is so we can weed out the low quality movies that we have.

The program should be able to keep a schedule and send `reminders` when somthing has not been uploaded yet

I also want to store the `MD5/CRC64/SHA512 Checksums` so we can run a data integrity checks periodically at our leasure.
